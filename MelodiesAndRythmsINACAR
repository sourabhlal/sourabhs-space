So listen, we need to talk. I'm not the best person when it comes to converting what what's in my head and my heart to what I say, and I'm sure you might want to want to say something in between, but I'm going to request that you let me finish before you do.
<br><br>
I'm going to start by teling you something from the day we first met. I was in the train the day coming back to lausane after the motor show, I was thinking I hope that's not the last time I meet that girl. And this isn't something normal for me - I've met so many people but there was just something different about this. So I don't know if you remember but I asked you about Bordeaux. I knew all the places you told me - they were on my map. But I needed a topic to talk about. Thankfully, we started talking and then we met a few times over the summer. And overtime I realized that I really like you.
<br><br>
You're such an inspiring and positive person, and I have really enjoyed spending time with you everytime we've met - even though its not been that many times. And its not just when we meet, sometimes if we're texting and you say something or I see something something you post online it just puts a smile on my face. Several times I've had boring or tough days and your message is the perfect thing I needed to hear. You are an inspiration!
<br><br>
So here's the thing, I'm a bit of an introvert. And what that meant is everytime I wanted to talk to you about this, there was always some reason not to. I was scared, I didn't want to ruin something potentially good. Further I also wanted to wait for the "perfect time". For example the first time I had decided that I would tell you all this was when we went for a walk to pelican park at night in September. But the whole time we were walking I was thinking, should I or shouldn't I. You just moved here, everything in your life was changing and I didn't want to put you in a difficult position with a decision to make. Then we didn't meet for months. And you know everytime something wasn't perfect.
<br><br>
And I kept delaying, and thinking of "strategies" for next time. But recently I saw something that inspired me. That encouraged me to be more direct and take a risk. To stop dreaming and actually take some action because if I don't I will always regret it.
<br><br>
And you know life isn't perfect, situations aren't perfect. But if I feel the way I do then that shouldn't matter. Because everytime we meet I think it is perfect. And so yeah. That's what I had on my mind. And now I have a question for you - the next time we meet, would you like to go out on a date with me?
