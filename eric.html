      Hey Eric,
      <br><br>
      First of all congratulations on your new job in Paris. I am really happy for you, and wish you all the best for your career. I have actually been thinking about telling you this for a long time, but wasn't sure how to express it. I'm not really the best at converting what's in my head and heart into words, so I decided to write this out rather than tell you in person (This is the 3rd draft, not even kidding).
      <br><br>
      There are just a handful of people who come to mind when I think about the impact they have had on my life in terms of making me who I am. And you are one of those people. I have really changed as a person in the last 3 years, and a large part of that is due to my friendship with you. I was always very reticent, and struggled to interact with people I didn't know. But you never cared about that and were always open and willing to talk. I still remember feeling extremely nervous when you invited me to your birthday in 2016. I felt quite out of place, but you made me feel welcome, even stepping away from the party and talking to just me. Soon you left for your internship, but when you came back we did the buddy group and that's when things really improved by leaps and bounds as for the first time ever I had a “social life”. Whether it was meeting just you or the whole group, it was something I hadn't ever done before. You really helped me to come out of my shell. This probably sounds a bit exaggerated, but for me our friendship (can add Vido to this as well) was definitely life-changing. You guys were always there when I needed to talk about something, or needed some advice, or simply was feeling down and didn't want to be alone. And I've never had friends like that before. Quick aside - you guys actually made one of my "smaller" dreams come true last month. Even though I don't really care too much about birthdays, I had always wanted to have friends who cared enough to organize a surprise party for me - and this year you guys did! :D Thank you again for that! I was genuinely surprised and also grateful although the fact that I was stressed about my project masked that.
      <br><br>
      Of course, cannot forget to mention all the work that we did on LauzHack. Sure, I am the one who wanted to start it, but it wouldn't have been possible without your constant support and dedication. That first edition of LauzHack it my most proudest achievements till date and you were a key part of it. Don't know if you knew this but I would never have even asked you if you wanted to be involved with it if you hadn't invited me to that escape room! After the Escape room we texted a few times, made plans to go to the Geneva Motor Show and discussed the hackathon for the first time on the train going there. 
      <br><br>
      I could ramble on forever, but gonna conclude here because I'm certain that we will stay in touch and there will be loads of opportunities to talk! While I know you have lots of friends, and that a lot of them closer to you than I am, I want you to know that I found our friendship extremely meaningful, and I will never forget it. Thanks so much for everything, and hope to see you soon!
      <br><br>
      Your Friend,<br>
      Sourabh

      P.S. Join instagram (perhaps as Georg Schofeld) - you only need to add Vidit and I on it. Will be a really easy way to stay in touch!
